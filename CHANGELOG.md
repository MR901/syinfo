## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.1.x to 0.2.0

1. **Update your dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade syinfo
   ```

2. **No breaking changes:**
   All existing code should continue to work without modifications.

3. **Optional: Use new APIs:**
   ```python
   # New simplified API
   import syinfo
   info = syinfo.get_system_info()
   syinfo.print_system_tree()
   ```

4. **Handle new exceptions:**
   ```python
   try:
       info = syinfo.get_system_info()
   except syinfo.SystemAccessError as e:
       print(f"System access error: {e}")
   except syinfo.DataCollectionError as e:
       print(f"Data collection failed: {e}")
   ```

5. **Test thoroughly:**
   Run your tests to ensure everything works as expected.
